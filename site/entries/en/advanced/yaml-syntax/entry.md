title: YAML Syntax
---

YAML (YAML Ain't Markup) is a human friendly data serialization language.

Flextype uses YAML because it's as close to plain English as data serialization and configuration formats get. It has no curly braces, it allows you to omit quotation marks for strings in most cases, and it relies on indentation for structure, which makes it incredibly readable compared to other languages, such as JSON and XML.
