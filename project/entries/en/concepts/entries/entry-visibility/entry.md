Content visibility is about controlling who can see your entries. Flextype allows you to control the visibility of your entries and Pages on an individual basis. By default, all entries are visible.

Available values for option `visibility`
* visible
* draft
* hidden

Also your entries can be routable and not. You can set `true` or `false` for `routable` option. By default it is `true`
